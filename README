This is the configuration we use to extract changesets and run gitdm on them.

* Tweaking your affiliation

This mostly happens in domain_map; there should be no need to touch
the 'oracle' and 'go-oo' files, which tag legacy account affiliation.

* Running mkstats.sh

To run this, you will also need a patched gitdm next to this repo;
something like this:

cd ..
git clone git://git.lwn.net/gitdm.git
cd gitdm
for p in ../gitdm-config/gitdm-patches/*; do
	patch -p1 < $p
done

Then - simply run:

./mkstats.sh

(which will clone a lot of repos under ./checkouts, make sure the
filesystem has some GB of space)

This no longer handles the old split-repo source setup, which was ~impossible
to extract accurate statistics out of, anyway. As an upshot, it now
handles almost every git repo that is under the TDF umbrella.

Having got that right - you should end up with a stats-$year-$week
directory containing the required data.

	Best of luck interpreting it.

Chart generation (AB etc)
Here's the generating howto:
- run ./mkstats.sh in gitdm-config
- take the old spreadsheets (in charts)
- insert sheet from category dir, file: git-hackers-data.csv
- data->pivot table->refresh on both Commits.. sheets
  (make sure the new months are added at the bottom)
- adapt the data ranges of the charts to the new rows & columns
